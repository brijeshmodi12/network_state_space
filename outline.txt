a)	Experimental Paradigm / Raw traces samples / Location of probe and tetrodes (histology)
b)	Construction of network state space / Using cartoon and actual data
c)	Occupancy and density map of state space
d)	Distribution of oscillators on state space 
e)	REM and Non-REM ratio overlay (along with raw traces and strict classification)
f)	Median power variation across trials 
g)	State dependent coupling between oscillators (correlation matrix)
h)	Speed of coverage and its variations across rem, non-rem and awake bouts
i)	Network flow in various bins, transition matrix and alterations in transition matrix across trials
j)	Framework Application: Cell firing overlay on state space and sparsity-based grouping of cellâ€™s signature on sleep state space
